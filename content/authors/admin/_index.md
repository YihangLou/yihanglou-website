I am now a senior researcher at Huawei Technology, Beijing.  Before that, I did my PhD at school EECS, Peking University (PKU), where I was co-advised by Prof. Lingyu Duan and Prof. Wen Gao. I received my bacheler at school of CS, Dalian University of Techonology (DLUT). 

My research interests include computer vision, deep learning and mobile computing etc. Specifically, I am actively conducting research on image retrieval (Re-Identification), Transfer Learning, Un/semi-supervised Learning and vision task involved with both low level and high level. I am engaging in applying the leading vision research to improve the intelligence and efficiency of smart city.
